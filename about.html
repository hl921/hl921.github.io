<h3>Bio</h3>


            <h4>As a Designer</h4>
<p>I have always wanted to be an artist since I was a kid. Drawing and painting were my passion (<a href="art.html">you can see my art here</a>). My interest shifted into graphic and experience design as I wanted to make my skills and talent more useful. Originally a Psychology major, I especially enjoyed Cognitive Psychology which was similar to fundamentals of Information Science. Psychology helps me when trying to understand the user‚Äôs experiences, behaviors, and emotions towards products. When I found the UX Design program, I thought it was a perfect combination of my passion for technology, psychology, and creativity.</p>

<p>I aspire to be a designer who highly values accessibility.  I hope to build applications that can be used by a wide range of people, including individuals who have visual, motor, auditory, speech, or cognitive disabilities. I also emphasize responsive design, improving the user experience by making it as elegant and readable on a mobile screen as it is on the web.</p>

<h4>As a Developer</h4>
<p>My internship experiences at Booz Allen were more on the coding and developing side, which was challenging but a huge learning experience. I was able to use my design background as my strength, contributing more to the front-end and usability. I also polished my coding skills, feeling like I can build a mobile application without anyone‚Äôs help.</p>

<h4>As an Entrepreneur</h4>
<p>Combining my entrepreneurial spirit and strong enthusiasm with slime, I am planning to launch my e-commerce slime shop called <a href="https://instagram.com/amangoslime">aMango Slime</a> ü•≠. I already have an Instagram account where I built my following from my previous account (don‚Äôt ask me what it was for). Currently, I am still in the process of building my website so stay tuned!</p>

<h4>As a Homosapien</h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid">Third Culture Kid</a> who lived in Seoul, Texas, Alabama, and Michigan my top strength became the ability to learn and adapt quickly. I also attended five different elementary schools, where I was always the new kid. As a result, I am not afraid of being in a new environment. I can adapt to uncomfortable situations and problem solve my way out. In my free time, I love to cook, watch cooking videos, watch mukbangs, and make tea. Yes, I am a foodie. I also wish I had a pet penguin, that's why my favicon is a penguin emoji (üêß). If you made it this far, thank you for reading my bio and visiting my portfolio. You're the best!</p>
