         <h3>The Problem</h3>
         <p>ORB is currently in a hyper-growth period with 300% growth in the last year. With this growth, ORB has introduced multiple customers from all over the world. These customers require a wide range of assets from ORB (Consumer Graphics, Logos, Working files, etc.). The current system in place for delivering these assets is through email requests.</p>
        <p>ORB is looking at building an online portal to distribute assets to customers with a back-end login access. This experience needs to be designed and optimized. We must create a new delivery system that allows the customers to select unique assets associated with brand and SKU. We need assets filed and sorted so the customers can be educated before they access the portal. We are also looking at doing a built-in form for the customer to fill out if they require custom assets not included on our portal. We need to create a customer friendly access point built into the ORBs website that will clearly communicate what ORB has to offer to their customers.</p>


        <h4>Client Mission</h4>
        <p class="quotes">“Encouraging Creativity, Imagination, & Independent Play”</p>
         <p>We plan on taking our clients mission statement into account when designing our asset portal to make sure that the designs are professional and usable, but also fun and creative like their products. This project has been something that ORB has been thinking about for a while. At the beginning of ORBs toy manufacturing journey, emails provided enough structure to fulfill all asset requests from sales members and retailers that were planning on carrying ORB products. Now, ORB is growing at a rate of 300% per year and need a more structured asset request infrastructure to support their needs and their customers' needs.</p>


         <h3>Project Goals</h3>
         <p>Since ORB’s current request system is through email, we are hoping to help create a system that will align with ORB’s rapid growth. Our main goal is for the portal to be simple and easy to use for ORB sales members and requestors—which will subsequently relieve a significant amount of work from the Asset Team, who is currently processing all of the asset requests and sending them back to the requesters personally.</p>

         <h3>Research</h3>
         <p>The research questions and goals facilitate our design process and allow us to focus in on function and usability rather than small aesthetic details. With a better understanding of our user’s expectations, behaviors, needs, motivations, and attitudes, we can properly design an asset request portal that performs successfully within the company.  We carefully curated these questions with a range of themes in order to establish context and requirements while also bringing us closer to our larger project goals.</p>
         <h4>Goals</h4>
         <ul>
             <li>Establish a firm understanding of standard data asset management structures by analyzing alternate software services.</li>
             <li>Review data from the current email system to establish a better understanding of how the asset request process currently works.</li>
             <li>Receive direct feedback from current users of the email system indicating what ways the current system falls short is inconvenient for them.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Questions</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>What are the pain points for users currently using this system and how would they like to see them addressed?</li>
              <li>What is the current perception of the email system and how do users want to see it changed, if at all?</li>
              <li>What conveniences do users find with the current system, if any?</li>
              <li>What ORB-specific content or features need to be added to this portal that standard DAM software might not include?</li>
<li>Which users will have access to this portal and what access rights should users havegiven their positions?</li>
           </ul>

         <br>
            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
         <p>TWe chose to look at a variety of different data asset management software and portals in our competitive analysis to understand what features are vital for ORB’s request portal. Four of the competitors were specifically used for asset management and the other four were more widely known cloud platforms where you can store files.</p>
<p>We decided to rank our competitors on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being effective and 5 being not effective, for each criterion and provide an explanation on why we rated it as so. For explanation of what we looked at for each criterion, see the appendix.</p>

</div>
         <h4>Categorization</h4>
         <p>Webdam and Reftab both had rankings of 5 for the categorization column. These sites were so successful for several reasons, but our biggest takeaways were the importance of customization in categorization (different ways to order folders and assets) and additionally metadata tag functionality.</p>

         <h4>Search</h4>
         <p>Google Drive assisted us in developing a solid understanding of search functionality. We found that the more options to search for the better and being able to search by things like keywords, file type, metadata tags, date added, etc.</p>

         <h4>Ease of Use</h4>

         <p>Reftab and Box promoted simplicity in their usage. Although DAM software need to support tons of different functionalities and it can be difficult to get lost in sometimes, simplistic design is vital to make sure that users don’t get confused and can't find what they need to as soon as possible.
         </p>

         <img src="images/box.png" alt="box.com" />
       </div>

         <h4>Aesthetics</h4>
         <p>For aesthetics, visually appealing sites are generally more enjoyable to use. Minimalistic design and on brand color schemes were very successful for providing appealing aesthetics.
         </p>

         <h4>Language</h4>
         <p>Simple language is incredibly important in software such as this. Webdam and OneDrive both did a great job at using simplistic language and if they needed to use a term that some users may not understand, having an option to hover over the confusing word and getting a more in- depth description was a great feature.
         </p>

         <h4>Personalization</h4>
         <p>Being able to personalize the portal based off of user preference will play a huge factor in our designs. Webdam and Reftab allowed users to change the organization of assets based off of user preference. Users can view assets in a grid view, list view, image view, etc. depending on what they enjoy the most.
         </p>

         <h4>Sharing</h4>
         <p>Almost every site offered great sharing options. If a user wants to share assets with other users, they have the option to click a button and receive sharing options like email, shareable links, text message, social media, etc.
         </p>




         <h3>User Surveys</h3>
         <p>Our user surveys helped us reach research goals such as “receive direct feedback from current users of the email” and answer questions like “what are the pain points for users currently using this system and how would they like to see them addressed.” With mainly open-ended questions, our purpose was to get a detailed insight from the actual users who go through the current asset request process.</p>

         <h4>Participants</h4>
         <div class="center icon">
          <img src="images/orbpart.png" alt="Participants" />
        </div>
<p>Our recruitment strategy was to receive survey feedback from our direct user who would be using this portal the most: the ORB Sales Team. Our client was able to send our survey on Google Form to the entire sales team who then filled it out for us. Their position titles at ORB were the following: International Administrative Assistant, Sales Coordinator, Sales Support, Sales Manager, Account Manager, and VP INTL Sales. We received a total of 8 responses, with each providing descriptive explanations on their experience with the current email system. The low number does have potential to introduce bias into our survey results, as we are only receiving feedback from a single team. We could be missing feedback from certain niche employees that would also use this site.</p>
